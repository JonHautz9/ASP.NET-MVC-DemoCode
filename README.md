# ASP.NET-MVC-DemoCode
The code in this example uses the ASP.NET MVC framework and a SQL database. It should also be noted that this code uses the Razor view engine.

There is a lot of code in this example but you need only refer to these specific files for my documentation.

The comments in Models/HelloModel.cs, Views/Home/Index.cshtml, and Controllers/HomeController.cs give an explanation of how the Models, Views, and Controllers work together.

The comments in App_Start/Routingconfig.cs give a brief explaination of the routing system and the comments in Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml explain the versatility of the layout page.

Also in Models/Products.cs there is an example of a data notation.
